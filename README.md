# Google Visualization Chart

The project has been developed in Laravel to display data using Google Visualization Charts, providing dynamic and interactive visual representations. The project involved integrating the Google Charts library with Laravel's backend, where data was fetched from a MySQL database and formatted as JSON to be compatible with Google Charts. I designed a RESTful API endpoint to serve the data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and seamless updates. The front-end utilized Vue.js for rendering the charts, offering users real-time insights into key metrics through various chart types such as line, bar, and pie charts. This implementation enhanced the user experience by providing clear and visually appealing data visualization, making complex information easy to understand and analyze.
